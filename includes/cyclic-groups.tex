\section{Cyclic groups}

\begin{definition}[Cyclic groups]
We say a group \(G\) is {\em cyclic} whenever there exists a \(x \in G\) such that \(G = \gen{x}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given a group \(G\) and \(x \in G\), we provide the exponentiation function \(\zz \times G \to G\), \((n, x) \to x^n\) by recursion:
\[x^n \coloneq \begin{cases}
1        & \text{if } n = 0 \\
x^{n-1}x & \text{if } n \ge 1 \\
\inv{(x^{-n})}   & \text{if } n \le 1.
\end{cases}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\). Then \(\gen x = \set{x^j \mid j \in \zz}\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For sure \(x^i \in \gen x\) for every \(i \in \zz\), hence \(\set{x^i \mid i \in \zz} \subseteq \gen x\). Besides, \(\set{x^j \mid j \in \zz}\) is a group which owns \(x\), because \(x^1 = x\): thus \(\gen x \subseteq \set{x^j \mid j \in \zz}\) as well.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\). Then these facts are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(G = \gen x\)
\item for every \(a \in G\) there is a \(n \in \zz\) such that \(a = x^n\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:SubgroupsOfCyclicGroupsAreCyclic}
Subgroups of cyclic groups are themselves cyclic.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider a group \(G\) and an \(x \in G\) such that \(G = \gen x\). There are two banal cases: \(G\) itself is a subgroup of \(G\) and is cyclic; \(\set 1\) is a subgroup and it is generate by \(1\). So, we focus on subgroups \(H\) that are neither \(\set 1\) nor \(G\). Then \(H\) has an element different from \(1\) and, since it is in \(G\), then it equals \(x^m\) for some \(m \in \zz\). But \(x^{-m} = \inv{(x^m)} \in H\) as well, because \(H\) is a subgroup. One between \(m\) and \(-m\) is positive, and this implies that the set
\[A \coloneq \set{i \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid x^i \in H}\]
is not empty: by the fact \(\nn\) is well ordered, we deduce \(A\) has a minimum, that we call \(s\). We show now that \(H = \gen{x^s}\). Obviously, \(\gen{x^s} \subseteq H\) because \(H\) is a subgroup. Let \(h \in H\): there is a \(n \in \zz\) such that \(h = x^n\). There are \(q, r \in \zz\) such that \(0 \le r \le s\) and \(n =qs +r\), and then
\[x^n = x^{qs+r} = (x^s)^q x^r = x^r .\]
If \(r > 0\), then \(r < s\) and \(x^r \in H\), which is an absurd; it must be necessarily \(r = 0\), that is \(n\) is a multiple of \(s\). So \(h \in \gen{x^s}\) and we have concluded.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:SubgroupsOfZ}
For every subgroup \(H\) of \(\zz\) there exists \(n \in \nn\) such that \(H = n\zz\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
In fact \(\gen a = a\zz\) and \(a \zz = (-a)\zz\) for \(a \in \zz\).
\end{proof}

From now on we study the finite cyclic groups.

\begin{lemma}Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\) such that \(\gen x\) is finite. Then
\[\set{i \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid x^i = 1} \ne \nil.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the function \(\nn \to \gen x\), \(i \to x^i\). Because \(\nn\) is infinite and \(\gen x\) is finite, this function cannot be injective. Thus there exists \(m, n \in \nn\) such that \(m \ne n\) and \(x^m = x^n\). One between \(m-n\) and \(n-m\) is positive, and in any case \(x^{m-n} = x^{n-m} = 1\). 
\end{proof}

\(\nn\) is well ordered, and this associated with the previous lemma legitimate the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Order of elements]
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\) such that \(\gen x\) is finite. Then we call {\em order} of \(x\) the natural number
\[\ord x \coloneq \min \set{n \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid x^n = 1}.\]
In that case \(x\) is said to be of \q{finite order}.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
Let \(G\) be a finite group. Every subset of \(G\) closed under the operation of \(G\) is a subgroup.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:OrdIsCardinality}
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\) of finite order. Then \(\ord x\) is the cardinality of \(\gen x\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider \(I \coloneq \set{0, \dots{}, \ord x-1}\) and the function
\[f : I \to \gen x\,, \ f(n) \coloneq x^n.\]
Take \(f(j) = f(k)\), that is \(x^j = x^k\). Without loss of generality, let us assume \(j \le k\). Then \(x^{k-j} = 1\). It must be \(j = k\), because otherwise \(0 < k-j < \ord x\) while \(x^{k-j} = 1\), absurd. Hence \(f\) is injective.\newline
For every \(s \in \zz\) there exist \(q, r \in \zz\) such that \(0 \le r < \ord x\) and \(s = q \ord x +r\). Now
\[x^s = x^{q \ord x +r} = \left(x^{\ord x}\right)^q x^r = x^r.\]
\(f\) is surjective too.\newline
To put all in a nutshell: we have found a bijection from \(I\), which has \(\ord x\) elements, to \(\gen x\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:CyclicIffOrdIsCard}
A finite group \(G\) is cyclic if and only if there exists \(x \in G\) such that \(\ord x = \lvert G \rvert\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Half of the work is already done in Proposition~\ref{prop:OrdIsCardinality}. Suppose \(G\) has an element \(x\) such that \(\ord x = \lvert G \rvert\): then \(\gen x = \set{1, x, \dots{}, x^{n-1}} \subseteq G\); since they are both finite and have the same cardinality, they must be equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:OrdDividesN}
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\) of finite group. Then
\[x^n = 1 \lrarr \ord x \text{ divides } n.\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
One part is obvious. Now suppose \(x^n = 1\). There exist \(q, r \in \zz\) such that \(0 \le r < \ord x\) and \(n = q \ord x +r\). Then \(1 = x^n = x^r\). By the definition of order of element, \(r = 0\) and so \(n\) is a multiple of \(\ord x\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Let \(G\) be a group and \(x \in G\) of finite order. Then
\[\ord\left(x^k\right) = \frac{\ord x}{\gcd(\ord x, k)} \quad \text{for every } k \in \zz.\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} By definition of order of elements, we have find the minimum of the set \(\set{n \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid \left(x^k\right)^n = 1}\). We have 
\begin{align*}
\set{ n \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid x^{kn} = 1} & = \set{n \in \nn^{\ge 1} \mid \ord x \text{ divides } kn} = \\
& = \set{n \in \nn^{\ge 1} \left\mid \frac{\ord x}{\gcd(\ord x, k)} \text{ divides } n\right.},
\end{align*}
whose minimum is \(\frac{\ord x}{\gcd(\ord x, k)}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let \(G\) be a finite cyclic group of cardinality \(s\). Then there exist exactly \(\phi(s)\) elements \(x \in G\) such that \(G = \gen x\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
So \(s = \ord x\). We have to seek for which \(r \in \set{1, \dots{}, s-1}\) we have \(G = \gen{x^r}\): this occurs, by Proposition~\ref{prop:CyclicIffOrdIsCard}, if and only if \(\ord \left(x^r\right) = s\), which itself is equivalent to \(\gcd(s, r) = 1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
For \(a, n \in \zz\), with \(n \ge 2\), we have
\[\ord [a]_n = \frac{n}{\gcd(a, n)}.\]
(Here, \([a]_n\) is an element of \(\zz/n\zz\).)
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:CyclicOneAndOnlySubgroup}
Let \(G\) be a finite cyclic group with cardinality \(s\). Then for every \(n \in \nn^{\ge 1}\) that divides \(s\) there exists one and only subgroup of \(G\) with cardinality \(n\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Above all, \(G = \gen x\) for some \(x \in G\) with \(\ord x = s\). Then for every \(n \in \nn^{\ge 1}\) that divides \(s\) we have
\[\ord\left(x^{\frac s n}\right) = \frac{s}{\gcd\left(s, \frac s n\right)} = n,\]
that is the subgroup \(\gen{x^{\frac s n}}\) of \(G\) has \(n\) elements. Now, consider a subgroup \(K\) of \(G\) with cardinality \(n\). By Proposition~\ref{prop:SubgroupsOfCyclicGroupsAreCyclic}, \(K\) is cyclic and \(K = \gen{x^l}\) for a suitable \(l \in \zz\). Hence
\[n = \ord{\left(x^l\right)} = \frac{s}{\gcd(s, l)}.\]
We have that \(l\) is a multiple of \(\frac s n\), and so \(K \subseteq \gen{x^{\frac s n}}\). Since \(K\) and \(\gen{x^{\frac s n}}\) are both finite with the same cardinality, they are actually equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:CyclicGroupsHavePhiNElemsOfOrdN}
Let \(G\) be a finite cyclic group of cardinality \(s\). For every \(n \in \nn^{\ge 1}\) that divides \(s\) there are exactly \(\phi(n)\) elements of order \(n\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{exercise}
Prove that for \(G\) group, \(C_1, C_2 \subseteq G\) finite cyclic subgroups and \(p\) prime number if \(\abs{C_1} = \abs{C_2} = p\), then \(C_1 \cap C_2 = \set{1}\) or \(C_1 = C_2\).
\end{exercise}
